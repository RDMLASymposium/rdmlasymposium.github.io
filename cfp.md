If you would like to participate in the Symposium, we welcome proposals that discuss the interplay of data and communities. This can include, but is not limited to:
 
  - What are some of the less-examined consequences of the ways we define and analyze data?
  - Who owns the data generated by/about communities?
  - What are some ways that collection and analysis of data can help give voice to, or silence, different communities?
  - What are the unexplored gaps and margins in our understanding and use of data?
  - How is data used to set boundaries and define the borders of communities?
  - In what ways does use of data legitimize some viewpoints and delegitimize others?
 
Presenters are encouraged to critically engage with the inherent power and systems of oppression present in data. Consider how individuals, organizations, programs, and research are dismantling these systems (including but not limited to racism, sexism, ableism, homophobia, transphobia, xenophobia, and classism), exposing gaps and silences in data, and challenging who owns data generated by/about groups and communities.
 
**Types of Proposals**

    - Propose a moderated three-to-four-person panel that will engage in live conversation with each other and with Symposium attendees on a topic relating to the year’s theme. Proposals must include a moderator, proposed panelists, and three example questions that might be discussed.
