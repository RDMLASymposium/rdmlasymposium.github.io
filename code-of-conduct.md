### RDMLA Symposium Code of Conduct
 
The Research Data Management Librarian Academy (RDMLA) values your attendance at the RDMLA Symposium and is committed to embodying and sustaining a welcoming and inclusive environment where everyone can participate fully in all activities without fear of harassment or discriminatory behavior. This code of conduct applies to anyone attending, associated with, and/or participating in the Symposium, including RDMLA members, non-members, vendors, and guests. This code of conduct applies to all spaces, both physical and virtual, managed by the RDMLA, including but not limited to the Symposium, workshops, social media, and community forums (e.g., email lists). Participation in any RDMLA activity in any capacity is a privilege and indicates assent to this code of conduct. By attending the RDMLA Symposium, we expect you to contribute to a supportive and harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of our backgrounds or differences.
 
Examples of harassing behavior include, but are not limited to, the following:
* Making hurtful and unwelcomed comments related to age, gender, gender identification, personal beliefs, physical appearance, physical or cognitive ability, sexual orientation, or race;
* Making unwelcomed or inappropriate interactions;
* Exhibiting lewd, bullying, or threatening behavior toward others;
* Stalking others in-person or online;
 
RDMLA is dedicated to providing a safe and respectful experience at the Symposium. Suggested small actions you can take to help us meet this goal include, but are not limited to, the following actions:
* Listening as much as you speak, and remembering that colleagues may have expertise you are unaware of;
* Encouraging and yielding the floor to those whose viewpoints may be under-represented in a group;
* Using welcoming language, for instance by using an individual’s stated pronouns and favoring gender-neutral collective nouns (e.g., “people,” not “guys”);
* Accepting critique graciously and offering it constructively;
* Giving credit where it is due;
* Seeking concrete ways to make physical spaces and online resources more universally accessible;
* Staying alert, as Active Bystanders, to the welfare of those around you;
 
Any participant engaging in harassing behavior may be warned and/or asked to leave by the Symposium Planning Committee members.
 
If you are being harassed, observe another participant being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the RDMLA Symposium Planning Committee at rdmla.help@gmail.com. You may email the committee members for less urgent matters or submit an <a href="https://hms.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_cMbBUDWwiiEsnAO" target="_blank">anonymous online form</a> should you feel uncomfortable reaching out in person. All reports and inquiries will be handled in confidence.
